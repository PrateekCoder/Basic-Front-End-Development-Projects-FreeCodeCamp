            <br><br>
            <p>
              <b>31st Oct 1875</b> : Born to a Gujarati family in the village of Karamsad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the fourth of the six children of his father, Jhaveribhai.
              He had three elder brothers, and a younger brother and sister.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1909</b> : In 1909, Jhaverba, who was suffering from cancer, underwent a major surgical operation. Though the operation was successful, Jhaverba’s health continued
              to decline. She passed away the same year. Patel was against remarrying and instead raised his children with the help of his family.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1911</b> : It was in the year 1911 that Vallabhbhai Patel finally lived his dream as he travelled all the way to England. He topped the 36-month course which he had
              enrolled in. It was a remarkable feat as Patel had no formal college education, unlike most others.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1917</b> : In 1917, Patel stood for an election to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad which he won comfortably. Meanwhile, Patel’s interest in politics grew,
              as he heard Gandhiji speak for the Swadeshi Movement. Inspired by the words of Gandhi, Patel started active participation in the Indian independence movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1920</b> : In 1920, Patel was nominated and elected as the President of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee. He supported the non-cooperative movement
              initiated by Gandhi.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1928</b> : In 1928, the village of Bardoli suffered from famine and steep tax hikes. To curb the problem, Sardar Patel organized a struggle, which called for non-violent unity
              from the villagers and a demand for complete denial of the taxes to the Government.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1931</b> : Vallabhbhai Patel was appointed as the interim leader of Congress in the 1931 Karachi session. During his term, Patel committed to protecting the fundamental
              rights and human freedom and envisioned India as a secular nation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1934</b> : Since 1934, Patel played a significant role in the Indian National Congress; he became chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board. His profile included raising funds,
              selecting candidates and determining Congress stance on issues and opponents. Though he did not contest in the election, he helped several Congressmen in getting elected
              in the provinces and at the national level
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1942</b> : Under the pressure of Gandhi and Patel, the All India Congress Committee launched the mass civil disobedience in the form of Quit India Movement on August 7, 1942.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1945</b> : Vallabhbhai Patel was arrested two days later on August 9 and was released after three years on June 15, 1945. Strikes, protests and revolutionary activities
              ruled India and Indians during this time with the result turning out in the country’s favour, as British decided to leave India and transfer the power to Indians.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>1946</b> : In the 1946 election for the Congress Presidency, Patel was nominated as the candidate for the elections. However, he refused the position on the advice of Gandhi,
              which was eventually taken over by Jawaharlal Nehru. The election was important in terms of the fact that the elected President would lead free India's first Government.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>15th Dec 1950</b> : Sardar Patel breathed his last on December 15, 1950 after a massive heart attack. He was cremated at Sonapur – the ceremony was attended by a million people,
              including Prime Minister Nehru, Rajagopalachari and President Prasad

            <br><br>
            <p>
              Popularly known as the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was one of the founding fathers of the Republic of India.
              A statesman of integrity, he played a quintessential role in helping India garner independence from the British rule. However,
              his role in the independence struggle did not end with just that as he was the man who guided the country to become a united, independent nation.
               Born in a Gujarati family, Patel was academically trained to become a lawyer. However, inspired by the works and teachings of Gandhi, he switched to give his
               life for the Indian struggle for independence. One of the leaders of the Indian National Congress, he raised to prominence in his home state for his outstanding
                work of saving peasants of Gujarat from the oppressive policies imposed by the British Raj, through non-violent civil disobedience. It wasn’t long before Patel
                became the trailblazer in the nationalist movement. It was for his ability to lead from the front that he was given the forename, Sardar, meaning Chief. Patel
                is also credited for establishing modern all-India civil services and for the same, is remembered as the ‘Patron Saint’ of India's civil servants. It was his sheer
                 sense of wisdom, practical acumen, sharp mind, great organizational skills and political insight that helped Patel become one amongst the greatest leaders of India.
